          <h3>Focused Lectures</h3>
          <p>
            Focused lectures will be poignant and students will be able to see
            the benefit of paying attention and trying to retain as much
            information as they can. Students often ask themselves ‚ÄúWhat is the
            point of this?‚Äù and that is an immediate way to kill any kind of
            engagement in a lecture

            A teacher is a beautiful gift given by god because god is a creator
            of the whole world and a teacher is a creator of a whole nation. A
            teacher is such an important creature in the life of a student, who
            through his knowledge, patience and love give a strong shape to a
            student's whole life.

            their speed, meaning that they can focus on things that they find
            challenging and breeze past things that they already know. This
            minimizes wasted time and promotes greater efficiency.

            Public speaking, also called oration or oratory, is the process of
            communicating information to a live audience. The type of
            information communicated is deliberately structured to inform,
            persuade, and entertain. Many people fear they suffer from a public
            speaking weakness and lack the will to master the skill.

          Cognitive development means how children think, explore and figure
          things out. It is the development of knowledge, skills, problem
          solving and dispositions, which help children to think about and
          understand the world around them. Brain development is part of
          cognitive development.
